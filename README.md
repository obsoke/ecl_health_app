Live Forever
==============
ECL500 Winter 2013 Project, a Health Tracking Android app.

This project was a great learning experience. It isn't the best looking Android
due to time constraints but I learnt a lot about writing Android apps,
Android fragments, using third-party Andrid libraries, Action Bars,
SQLite, and data serialization.
